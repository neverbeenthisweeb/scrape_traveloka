Flow of the script summary:  
1. In the city loop (starts from row 47), 
  - the script type the city name from the cities list to the search box in the website.
  - Then, the script will select city option or area option based on the city name typed (in that order).
  - The script continues to the next loop.
  - If both of the options are not found, script will skip that city name and append it to the unfound_cities list.
2. The page loop (starts from row 71):
  - After the city loop, the browser get to the first page of hotel listing result.
  - Scrap the data from that page and add the data to the hotels dataframe.
  - Find the next button.
  - If the button is not found, means the browser get to the last page. Then the loop breaks, the script goes back to the city loop.
  - If the button is found,  script then click the button to get to the next page.
